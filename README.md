## Where the heck am I?

This is a collection of tools that are too cool to just rot on my local drive, but too small for an own git... If you notice any goofy behavior or have some ideas to improve stuff feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Keeky/keeky.github.io/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Keeky/keeky.github.io/pulls).
